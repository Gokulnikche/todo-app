### In my React To-Do application project, I included all the required features as you mentioned:
Frontend:
React Components: I built the entire layout using React components.
CSS Styling: Styled the app using CSS and Bootstrap to ensure it looks good and works well responsive on different devices.
JavaScript Logic: Used modern JavaScript to handle the appâ€™s functionality.

React Components and State Management:

Functional Components and Hooks: Created the app with functional components and used React hooks like useState and useEffect.
I have Developed two main components that provide:
TaskInput: It's for adding new tasks.
TaskList: It's for showing and managing the list of tasks, including deleting and prioritizing them.
Redux for State Management: Implemented Redux with Thunk to handle global state and manage API requests.

Responsive Design:

Responsive Layout: The app will be responsive and work well on mobile, tablet, and desktop using CSS Grid and Flexbox, starting with a mobile-first approach.

Functionality:

Add Task: Users can add tasks by typing and pressing a button or just Enter.
View Tasks: It will display all tasks in a list format.
Delete Task: Tasks can be removed with a delete button.
Task Prioritization: Allows setting priorities (High, Medium, Low) for tasks.
Persistent Storage: Used local storage to keep tasks and login status even after closing the browser.

User Authentication:

Mock Authentication: I have added a simple login and logout feature using Redux, so only authenticated users can access their tasks.
